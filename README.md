# 6 Coils Guitar Pickup
## EXI-CCW, Six Continous Coils Winding guitar pickup

EXI -  SIX in Greek.
CCW -  Continous Coils Winding, 

The coils / diffferential input of the OP amp have no soldering between the coils (less noise).

### LESS HUM, BETTER PICK ATTACK, STRING SEPARATION, LESS HARMONICS, MUDDY SOUND GONE 


All EasyEda PCB's for different version are in EadyEDA folder.

This is an active guitar pickup with one coil per string. It has 6 coils.
Made by ghitara dot com, this high-quality pickup is designed to provide exceptional sound and performance. 
The model sexa-ccw is a perfect choice for those who want to upgrade their guitar's sound. This electric guitar pickup is perfect 
for enhancing the sound of your guitar due low inductance. Each coil has between 500 and 800 turns. The frequency response is better than 
classic guitar pickups. I did tests on EMG active pickup and Harley Benton Passive, see Bode diagrams below.

  * Frequency response

    Here Ive tested couple of pickups I had handy in the range of 100 to 15 Khz. The probe is a coil with almost
    0 inductance to to avoid low frewquency resonance and is made of 140 turns of 0.1mm wire on a wood coffe stiring stick.

### Single or dual coil pickups problems
A regular pickup coil is extremely inefficient. The shape of the coil is elongated along all strings.This decreases the coil inductance, actually you barely can calculate the inductance of such a coil. A second factor is the permeability of the mixed plastic and string iron nuts. 70% of the inner core is plastic. The whole core adds up to 480 .. 500 squared mm. The nuts area is: 6(nuts) x PI x 2.5mm(radius)^2 â†’ 110..120 squared mm. This represents 25%. To compensate such inneficiency the coil has around 6000 .. 8000 turns, with a wire which adds up a lot of capacitance and resitance. Such a coil has 1.8 to 2.5 Henrys. A humbucker dual coil would be double, like 4..5 Henrys.

This huge number of turns adds up parasite capacitance. This makes the standard pickup sound dull and muddy. Exi coil uses 6 separate coils with 99% full iron core. Exi pickup achieves same inductance with 10 times fewer turns. Coils turns tunning and proper phasing and assembly makes the magnetic field uniform across the pickup. Exi-pickup has 10 times less turns, reduced capacitance, the sound is much clean and the muddy effect is almost gone.
